    blurb: "My name is Chaoran Deng, CFA and I started this website to stay up to date with the markets while creating insightful, grounded research on select equities. The goal isn’t to predict prices, but to analyze everything based on facts and numbers. This site also serves as a personal reference, so I can look back on my previous notes and track how my thinking evolves over time.",
    introduction: "Hi, I’m Chaoran, a CFA charterholder and investment professional. I care deeply about clear thinking, understanding risk, and creating long-term value. I started this site to write through markets in real time — not to predict prices, but to explain what matters, what doesn’t, and how to think about uncertainty. Most financial content is either too noisy or too technical. My goal here is to sit in the middle: rigorous, but readable.",
    background: "I’ve spent years studying companies, markets, and macroeconomic forces across cycles. I’m fascinated by what drives businesses to succeed, how competitive dynamics shape industries, and how macroeconomic trends impact individual companies. I also pay close attention to how capital is allocated, because the way a company invests its resources often tells you more about its future than any short-term metric. Good investing isn’t about having bold opinions; it’s about exercising sound judgment when information is imperfect.",
    philosophy: "My philosophy is simple: understand the business first, focus on risk over upside, and rely on probabilities rather than predictions. I value simplicity over complexity and am comfortable saying “I don’t know” when the facts aren’t clear. Most mistakes in investing come from overconfidence, not intelligence.",
    findings: "On this site, I share weekly market outlooks, structured company analysis, and broader perspective pieces on growth, rates, and structural trends. It’s my personal research space — opinionated at times, but always grounded in reasoning. This isn’t financial advice, a stock-picking service, or a real-time trading platform. It’s a way for me to share how I think about investing and to help readers think clearly about uncertainty.",
    quote: "Markets change. Good thinking compounds.",
